found a lot of stuff that can help to set up mongodb. need to be able to properly run. 

module.exports: export one things export: export many things 

useNewUrlParser is depreciated
try mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);

I THOUGHT node app.js isnt working.
It was, it just didnt show anything on the terminal until I added
console.log(process.env.MONGODB_URI)
I forget to turn on mongodb! Everything was added there

keep playing around with it


the env is the database. the models i am generating, titled and based on schemas, are different collections
can update multiple things at a time
